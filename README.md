# gcp-vpc-network-setup
A project demonstrating the setup of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Compute Engine instances on Google Cloud.

# GCP VPC Network Setup and VM Deployment 🚀

## 📋 Overview
This project showcases a basic implementation of a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** and **Compute Engine VM instances** using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It includes setting up an auto mode VPC network, configuring firewall rules, and creating virtual machines (VMs). The project is based on a hands-on lab experience and provides a good demonstration of Google Cloud networking fundamentals.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
  - Google Compute Engine
  - Google Cloud VPC
  - Firewall Configuration
- **YAML & JSON** for configuration files
- **SSH** for remote VM access

## 🗂️ Project Structure
gcp-vpc-network-setup/ ├── README.md ├── network-config.yaml ├── firewall-rules.json ├── instance-deployment.md 


- **README.md**: Main documentation file.
- **network-config.yaml**: YAML configuration for VPC network setup.
- **firewall-rules.json**: JSON file containing custom firewall rules.
- **instance-deployment.md**: Detailed step-by-step guide for VM deployment.
- **images/**: Screenshots and visuals of the setup process.

## 🎯 Objectives
In this project, you will learn:
1. How to explore the default VPC network in GCP.
2. How to create a custom auto mode VPC network.
3. How to set up firewall rules for secure communication.
4. How to deploy and configure Compute Engine VM instances.
5. How to test connectivity between VM instances using SSH and ICMP.

## 📝 Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of cloud computing and GCP.
- Access to a GCP account (or Qwiklabs for temporary access).
- Installed Google Cloud SDK (for optional command-line operations).
